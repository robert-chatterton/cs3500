Changelog to existing code:
- Renamed isIllegalPosition() to offBoard(), I think this name is more accurate and clear
- Added protected method getBuffer(), which determines the number required to check if a piece should be on the board or not
	- Reduces duplicate code
	- Utilized in the creation of the game boards as well as in the getGameState() method for determining spaces
- Created an abstract class AbstractSolitaireModel, in order to reduce code duplication throughout the project
	- Implements the MarbleSolitaireModel interface
	- All fields from MarbleSolitaireModelImpl now exist in the abstract class
	- MarbleSolitaireModelImpl, EuropeanSolitaireModelImpl, and TriangleSolitaireModelImpl all extend from this abstract class
	- Majority of the code from MarbleSolitaireModelImpl's methods were moved to this abstract class
- In move(), reduced code duplication through local variables, and clarified the conditions for moving
	- Fixes a few movement bugs
- No changes to MarbleSolitaireControllerImpl
